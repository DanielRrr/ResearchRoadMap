### Generalisation of results in theory of locales by Dragalin and Bezhanishvili/Holliday

In the late 1970s, [Dragalin](https://books.google.ru/books/about/Mathematical_Intuitionism.html?id=n_ecAwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) proved that any spatial locale
(that is, this locale has enough points) is isomorphic to the algebra of fixpoints generated by a nucleus operator in some normal Dragalin frame.

Several years ago, [Guram Bezhanishvili and Wesley Holliday](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2s0134zx) proved stronger result:
any locale is isomorphic to the algebra of fixpoints in some standard normal Dragalin frame.

It seems that it makes sense to stregnthen those results in terms of categorical equivalence.

TODO No. 1: Define p-morphisms between Dragalin frames and their instances for normal and standard normal ones.
(As Shehtam told me, nobody had done that before). Also one needs to ensure that this hypothetical p-morphism has the same
behaviour as usual one for Kripke frames (that is, the standard p-morphisms for those morphisms between Dragalin frames).
My assumption: one may try to consider/introduce coalgebra on Dragalin frames and extract desired p-morphism conditions after that

TODO No. 2: (This issue should be solved after the first one) Determine what moprhisms between of spatial locales correspond
to p-morphisms of normal Dragalin frames.
My assumption (perhaps, it's rubbish): it's worth to take a look at open morphisms of spatial locales.

TODO No. 3: Prove that the category of spatial locales and open (?) morphisms is equivalent to the category of normal Dragalin frames and p-morphisms. That is, a functor from the category of spacial locales and open morphisms to the category of normal Dragalin frames has left adjoint and unit and counit of this adjunction are isomorphisms.

TODO No. 4: The same issue but for locale homomorphisms p-morphisms of standard normal Dragalin frames.
My assumption is the same, but for open morphisms of locales.

TODO No. 5: Prove that the category of locales and open morphisms is equivalent to the category of standard normal Dragalin frames via adjunction as in TODO No. 3.

TODO No. 6: Determine how exactly normal Dragalin frame might be connected with sober spaces.
